BasicIncomeCoin is part of a series of experiments intended to find workarounds for the problem for decentralized crypto currency based basic income allocation. The general thinking at the moment is to use incomecoin.com to index the funds allocated by basicincomecoin.com, as a way of weighting votes cast using votecoin.com, that favour particular distributions of payouts to basicincomecoin wallet holders. It's a mouthful but the problem seems to require multiple interacting mechanisms to establish unique identities for basicincomecoin recipients.

 - "RBC runs on a digital payments platform called E-dinheiro, which helps towns like Maricá circulate their own currencies — backed by Brazilian reais but accepted only within their own communities. People with smartphones can use the E-dinheiro app to transfer digital credits between themselves and other users of their community currency, make purchases from retailers like Ramos, and pay their utility bills. Those without smartphones can use the service by scanning their cards or asking a friend or family member with the app to conduct a transaction on their behalf. Today, there are more than 40 municipalities across Brazil using the platform...Unlike other social currency initiatives, E-dinheiro doesn’t run on blockchain or any cryptocurrency technology: Mumbucas are effectively reais that can be used only within Maricá’s limits and can be spent only through the platform’s digital payments system. Those receiving the Mumbucas as part of the basic income program can’t swap them for reais, but business owners can cash them out after a 48-hour waiting period and by paying a 1% fee of the amount to be withdrawn." https://restofworld.org/2020/your-money-is-no-good-in-marica/

 - No time to do a rigourous review of this UBI coin "duniter" but this article https://medium.com/@marma.developer/if-when-shit-hits-the-fan-and-the-global-financial-system-collapses-62dae5860369 describes it as "a Universal Basic Income in the form of a crypto-currency implemented via a decentralized, permissionless blockchain, applying the principle of the Relative Theory of Money." based on the "the Relative Theory of Money" which seems to be an invention of the author. According to a definition here: https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Relative_Theory_of_Money it is "which is the only way to avoid both spatial and temporal asymmetry toward money issuance". The full paper here: http://en.trm.creationmonetaire.info/TheorieRelativedelaMonnaie.pdf Some of the diagrams at the end of the paper look very similar in spirit to my earlier thoughts on a differential equation for VoteCoin. "[the cryptocurrency]called G1 (pronounced “June”) and can be downloaded/explored further here: www.duniter.org In order to “create” or open an account which is entitled to receive a daily UD, the person needs to be “certified” as being a “real” person by at least 5 existing members, via a physical “in person” meeting (the technology relies on the open source “web of trust” system). This certificate needs to be renewed every 2 years so if that person cheats and opens several accounts in order to get more UD, there is always a risk that his accounts will not be renewed if he/she cheats and is discovered."

## Ideas/questions  

It seems like there must be an external source of value coming into the system from somewhere. Here's where there could be a role for commitcoin/patentcoin or something to track digital "deeds" for things in the real world. Initial funding could come from a set of bequeathments.  

Are indefinite student loans sort of like UBI? One based on conscripting you to learn sort of.
