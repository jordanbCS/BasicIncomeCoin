BasicIncomeCoin is part of a series of experiments intended to find workarounds for the problem for decentralized crypto currency based basic income allocation. The general thinking at the moment is to use incomecoin.com to index the funds allocated by basicincomecoin.com, as a way of weighting votes cast using votecoin.com, that favour particular distributions of payouts to basicincomecoin wallet holders. It's a mouthful but the problem seems to require multiple interacting mechanisms to establish unique identities for basicincomecoin recipients.

## Ideas  

The proof of work could be a kind of simulation, like running SimCity, where the results of interest were based on voting a particular way at the start. Miners would be performing Monte Carlo simulations guided by the "Metropolis" algorithm, or some kind of generative and inferential process that estimates the likelihood of particular, voted upon, societal outcomes from a prior wealth distribution over wallets.
