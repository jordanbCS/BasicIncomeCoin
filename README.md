# Public repository for BasicIncomeCoin.com

Part of a series of experiments intended to find workarounds for the problem for decentralized crypto currency based basic income allocation. The general thinking at the moment is to use incomecoin.com to index the funds allocated by basicincomecoin.com as a way of weighting votes cast using votecoin.com that favour particular distributions of payouts to basicincomecoin wallet holders. It's a mouthful but the problem seems to require multiple interacting mechanisms to establish unique identities for basicincomecoin recipients.
