BasicIncomeCoin is part of a series of experiments intended to find workarounds for the problem for decentralized crypto currency based basic income allocation. The general thinking at the moment is to use incomecoin.com to index the funds allocated by basicincomecoin.com, as a way of weighting votes cast using votecoin.com, that favour particular distributions of payouts to basicincomecoin wallet holders. It's a mouthful but the problem seems to require multiple interacting mechanisms to establish unique identities for basicincomecoin recipients.

 - No time to do a rigourous review of this UBI coin "duniter" but this article https://medium.com/@marma.developer/if-when-shit-hits-the-fan-and-the-global-financial-system-collapses-62dae5860369 describes it as "a Universal Basic Income in the form of a crypto-currency implemented via a decentralized, permissionless blockchain, applying the principle of the Relative Theory of Money." based on the "the Relative Theory of Money" which seems to be an invention of the author. According to a definition here: https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Relative_Theory_of_Money it is "which is the only way to avoid both spatial and temporal asymmetry toward money issuance". The full paper here: http://en.trm.creationmonetaire.info/TheorieRelativedelaMonnaie.pdf Some of the diagrams at the end of the paper look very similar in spirit to my earlier thoughts on a differential equation for VoteCoin. "[the cryptocurrency]called G1 (pronounced “June”) and can be downloaded/explored further here: www.duniter.org In order to “create” or open an account which is entitled to receive a daily UD, the person needs to be “certified” as being a “real” person by at least 5 existing members, via a physical “in person” meeting (the technology relies on the open source “web of trust” system). This certificate needs to be renewed every 2 years so if that person cheats and opens several accounts in order to get more UD, there is always a risk that his accounts will not be renewed if he/she cheats and is discovered."

## Ideas/questions  

It seems like there must be an external source of value coming into the system from somewhere. Here's where there could be a role for commitcoin/patentcoin or something to track digital "deeds" for things in the real world. Initial funding could come from a set of bequeathments.  

Are indefinite student loans sort of like UBI? One based on conscripting you to learn sort of.
